# Representing Organic Matter Thermodynamics in Biogeochemical Reactions via Substrate-Explicit Modeling

A repository for the publication entitled ``Representing Organic Matter Thermodynamics in Biogeochemical Reactions via Substrate-Explicit Modeling`` (doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.531756, [Preprint link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.968669v1)). In this paper, we proposed a new concept of biogeochemical modeling (termed substrate-explicit modeling) that enables parameterizing organic matter (OM)-specific oxidative degradation pathways and reaction rates based on the thermodynamic properties of OM pools.
